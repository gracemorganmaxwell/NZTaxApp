        <h5>Sole Trader or Self Employed:</h5>
        <p>
          A sole trader is an individual running their own business. They are
          the sole owner and are personally responsible for the businessâ€™s debts
          and obligations. Sole traders declare their business income on their
          personal tax return, and they pay personal income tax on their
          business profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "self-employed" broadly refers to anyone who works for
          themselves, whether as a sole trader, a contractor or even part of
          a partnership. Self-employed individuals are responsible for filing
          their tax returns and paying tax on their income.
        </p>
        <h5>Contractor:</h5>
        <p>
          Contractors are individuals who provide services to another entity
          under a contract for services, rather than as an employee. Contractors
          can work in various fields, ranging from construction to freelance
          writing. Like sole traders, contractors pay tax on their income
          through their tax returns, and their tax rates depend on
          their total income.
